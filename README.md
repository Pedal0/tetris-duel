# Multiplayer Tetris

## Project Overview
Multiplayer Tetris is an engaging multiplayer game that pits a human player against an AI opponent in a side-by-side grid layout. The application is designed to provide a fun and competitive environment, featuring real-time scoring and unique game rules. The human player can control their pieces using keyboard inputs, while the AI automatically places its pieces based on simple algorithms. The game also includes special mechanics such as surprise gifts, funny pieces, and rainbow effects to enhance gameplay.

## Features
- Two separate grids displayed side by side for human and AI players.
- Keyboard controls for human player to move and rotate Tetris pieces.
- Simple AI logic for automatic piece placement.
- Real-time scoreboard showing scores for both players.
- Scoring mechanism for completing lines with bonus points for multiple lines.
- Special game rules including:
  - Surprise gifts that provide bonuses.
  - Gentle pauses to allow players to catch up.
  - Funny pieces that add humor to gameplay.
  - Rainbow effects for visual enhancement.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
- **Flask**: Version 2.0 or higher
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Basic knowledge required for understanding frontend logic
- **Browser**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiplayer-tetris.git
   $ cd multiplayer-tetris
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file** to store environment variables:
   ```bash
   $ touch .env
   ```
   Add any necessary environment variables as needed.

## Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration settings can be managed using a `.env` file in the project root. This may include variables for game settings, such as difficulty level or AI behavior.

## Deployment
1. **Prepare for deployment**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and the application runs locally.
2. **Choose a hosting platform**: Options include Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
3. **Deploying on Heroku**:
   - Install the Heroku CLI and log in:
     ```bash
     $ heroku login
     ```
   - Create a new Heroku application:
     ```bash
     $ heroku create multiplayer-tetris
     ```
   - Push code to Heroku:
     ```bash
     $ git push heroku master
     ```
   - Open the application in a browser:
     ```bash
     $ heroku open
     ```

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to the deployed application URL.
2. Use the arrow keys to move and rotate Tetris pieces as a human player.
3. Watch the AI opponent place its pieces automatically.
4. Track your score in real-time on the scoreboard.

## Project Structure
- **static/**: Contains all static assets including stylesheets and JavaScript files.
  - `style.css`: Styles for the game layout.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript for game logic and behavior.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML files for rendering the game interface.
  - `index.html`: Main HTML structure for the game.

## API Documentation
- **No external API endpoints are currently available for this game.**

## Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: Game does not start.
  - **Solution**: Check if all dependencies are installed correctly. Ensure the server is running.
- **Issue**: The AI does not make moves.
  - **Solution**: Inspect the AI logic in `script.js` to ensure it's correctly implemented.

## Development
1. **Setting up a development environment**:
   - Follow the installation steps above.
   - Use your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) for development.
2. **Running the application**:
   ```bash
   (venv) $ flask run
   ```
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. **Testing changes**:
   - Make changes to `script.js` or `index.html` and refresh the browser to see updates.
